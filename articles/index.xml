      <description>Electricity can be thought of as a fluid flowing through cables. Hence it is possible to mimic the operations of a computer with fluids.
In fact there is a whole engineering discipline devoted to this called fluidics and micro fluidics when dealing with extremely miniaturized devices. These devices work by using vacuum or pressure to pull or push a fluid through an intricate set of tiny pipes or tunnels. Presently the field of fluidics is mainly concerned with making devices for chemical and biological laboratories.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of sources, tutorial, wiki pages and what not about cryptography, so I will not try to repeat that here. Instead this will be mainly an overview, to help you figure out what is out there. I will also try to explain concepts which I believe are not explained very well elsewhere. The focus will be on cryptography as a user. Understand enough to be able to pick the right tools and approaches.</description>
