      <description>I am not aiming to give an exhaustive guide here. This is mainly to get you started. I will link to more in depth articles. The problem I am trying to address here is that when you start out you end up on a wild goose chase with google to find out stuff. I will focus on mentioning mistakes I&amp;rsquo;ve made which might aid in getting the right parts or using them correctly.</description>
