      <description>This is a rather hillarious heading, because who in their right mind believes in torture. Most people will say &amp;ldquo;I support human rights&amp;rdquo;. But then there are those who come with a big BUT. But there are of course those exceptional cases they say where an attack is imminent and we could tward the terrorists from killing thousands. This might of course also question how valuable is really human rights which only extends to those you love or deem good people, while nasty people don&amp;rsquo;t get it.</description>
