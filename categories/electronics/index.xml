      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a distilation of my last weeks of experience building an AVR curcuit on a breadboard and prototype board and programming it in assembly. Look at one of my previous post to see how you get up to speed with the assembler, avrdude for transfering programs etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Continuity Buzzer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I wanted to check whether to points on my circuit were connected before I turned my multimeter on measuring resistance (power turned off of course). If it measured around 0 ohm I knew I had a connection. Only recently I got a much nicere multimeter and I discovered how much faster you can do this with a continuity buzzer. It works pretty much the same as my old approach. I can still see the resistance in ohms. However it also gives off a beep each time resistance is zero. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how usefull that was until I started checking my circuits for problems. You can just move your test probes along quickly without every moving your eyes away from the circuit and just listen for the buzz. I was surprised by how much faster I could check lots of lines on my circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my prototype board were I just built a development board for 8 pin AVR microcontrollers (see previous post) I was often not sure if my soldering was good or if I had connected everything correctly. The board was a mess of cables so it was easy to forget connections which I did. With the continuity buzzer my approach was to first place one test probe on ground and then move the second one along every point of the circuit which is supposed to be connected to ground and listen for a beep. Then I repeat the same procedure for Vcc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Printf type debugging on a Microcontroller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When developing software I would use one of my LEDs for debugging. So e.g. if I wrote a program where you could adjust the frequency of the blinking of the green LED, then I would use the yellow LED for debugging. I would write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sbi PINB, PB1 ;flip yellow LED
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To flip the LED from on to off or off to on. Writing 1 to the input register, as opposed to the output register does that. I would move this line around in the program to make sure that I hit the appropriate section of code when I expected. A limiting factor is that you can not keep this line in a lot of places, because you can not distinguish between them. This is not as problematic as it sounds, since the programs you write on a ATtiny13 in assembly will probably be quit small. If you write larger programs I recommend using the Arudino instead or investing in a proper development board from ATMEL. I did all my development using TextMate 2.0 with an AVR assembly bundle. I then had a hotkey for building and one for uploading. It worked quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Clock signal mistakes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating the hardware, by far the mistake which cost me the most time was mixing up CLKI and SCK (pin 2 and 7) on the AVR. I thought I should use CLKI for the clock pin 3 on the ISP6 connector. Then nothing works and you get the same error message from avrdude as you would have gotten if no cable was connected. Actually avrdude gives the same error for almost anything it seems. Other than that most of my mistakes were in software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Messing up unsigned arithmetic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You really ought to get a grasp of unsigned aritmetic. Since you typically work with 8bit values you often have to use unsigned numbers to be able to have numbers in the range 0 to 255 and not just -128 to 127. When branching you should then not use instructions such as:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height:13px;&#34;&gt;BRLT (&lt;strong&gt;BR&lt;/strong&gt;anch if &lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt;ower &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;han)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;BRGE (&lt;strong&gt;BR&lt;/strong&gt;anch if &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;reater or&lt;b&gt; E&lt;/b&gt;qual)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;BRMI (&lt;strong&gt;BR&lt;/strong&gt;anch if &lt;b&gt;MI&lt;/b&gt;nus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
These instructions will typically treat the numbers in the comparisons or arithmetic instructions preceding them as signed numbers with range -128 to 127. The problem with that is that if you write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ldi r16, 128
cpi r16, 127
brge r16Greatest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might expect this code to branch to &lt;em&gt;r16Greatest, &lt;/em&gt;since 128 &amp;gt; 127. But it wont because BRGE is treating the numbers as signed. Then 128 is -128, and -128 &amp;lt; 127, so there will be no branching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;Understanding timers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second big misunderstanding was the timer/counter system. Register TCNT0 counts upwards constantly and you can use it as a sort of timer or to generate PWM signals on the output. One way of using it is to toggle an output pin OC0B (PB1) or OC0A (PB0) whenever I/O register TCNT0 is equal to I/O register OCR0B or OCR0A. You can configure this in one of the timer controll registers. So far so good. The problem arose when using something called CTC mode. When using CTC, the TCNT0 register will be reset to 0 each time TCNT0 equals OCR0A. The last part is the imporant. You can only use OCR0A for this purpose on ATtiny13. When TCNT0 equals OCR0B it will toggle the OC0B pin if you have enabled that but it will never reset TCNT0. There is no way of configuring that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implication of that is also that you can not blink your LEDs at different frequency, but you may blink them out of phase, since OCR0B need not be the same as OCR0A. When I first set this up I did not understand this difference so I wrote a value into OCR0B thinking that would affect the frequency of LED blinking. I did not get any blinking at all. Just a steady light because OCR0A was 0, since it was never set. Thus when TCNT0 got reset it immediatly got the same values as OCR0A again. When turning on interrupts, this had the effect of making the interrupt only fire once.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Development board for 8 pin AVR microcontrollers</title>
      <link>http://translusion.github.com/posts/avrdevboard/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got a bunch of ATtiny13 AVR microcontroller chips because I tought it would be fun to see what you can do with a tiny 8 pin microcontroller. The thought first popped into my mind when I looked at a project for creating motor controller for an electric spinning wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project used the same chip as in an arduino with an arduino bootloader. The ATmega328 is a lot more expensive than a ATtiny13. You can get a tiny for around 20 Kr at e.g. &lt;a title=&#34;electrokit&#34; href=&#34;http://www.electrokit.com&#34;&gt;electrokit&lt;/a&gt; in sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of projects such as motor controllers with buttons or a dial for controlling speed does not need anything more than a tiny13, and a small program. My first problem however hooking up the circuit below to program one of my tiny13s, is that it is easy to connect the cables to the programmer wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;caption id=&#34;&#34; align=&#34;alignnone&#34; width=&#34;650&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pluggerogkontakter.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_0648.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img id=&#34;i-179&#34; class=&#34; wp-image&#34; title=&#34;ATtiny13 development breadboard&#34; src=&#34;http://pluggerogkontakter.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_0648.jpg?w=650&#34; alt=&#34;ATtiny13 development breadboard&#34; width=&#34;650&#34; height=&#34;365&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Development board for AVR ATtiny13 microcontroller on breadboard, connected to a AVR-ISP500 programmer from Olimex. Pin 2 and 7 are connected to push buttons, which will pull the pins LOW when pushed (will connect to GND). Pin 6 and 5 drive a yellow and green LED through 2 transistors. The two transistors and 22K Ohm resistors are there to avoid interfering with the programmer, since it uses those pins for MISO and MOSI.&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example above is not too bad because I used colored wires with one female and one male end. Thus I could connect the female end directly to the output of the programmer and the male end into the breadboard. But if you have to connect into the connector of a ISP6 cable then it is easy to get the pin numbering wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that is why I build the above curcuit first on a breadboard, tested it and then built it on the prototype board below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;caption id=&#34;&#34; align=&#34;alignnone&#34; width=&#34;650&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pluggerogkontakter.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_0653.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img id=&#34;i-216&#34; class=&#34; wp-image&#34; title=&#34;ATtiny13 development board&#34; src=&#34;http://pluggerogkontakter.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_0653.jpg?w=650&#34; alt=&#34;ATtiny13 development board&#34; width=&#34;650&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pin 2 and 7 are connected to push buttons, which will pull the pins LOW when pushed (will connect to GND). Pin 6 and 5 drive a yellow and green LED through two 2N2222 transistors. Potentiometer is connected to pin 3. Red LED indicates that our LM7805 voltage regulator is delivering power. On the bottom right there is a ISP6 connector for in system programming.&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a ISP6 connector (black 2x3 pins). With this there is only one way to connect the cable from your programmer, so it is very quick to connect your 8 pin AVR microcontroller to a programmer. A lot of devboards contains the bare minimum of components. I wanted to be able to test most of my ideas and programs directly on my development board without having the move the chip to another circuit to do actual work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my development board has the following inputs and outputs which I believe I will typically be using for most projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 14px;&#34;&gt;2 outputs connected to a green and yellow LED. These are connect to pins which can do PWM, since I will need that for motor controller programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 digital inputs connected to push buttons. Assume pullup resistor is enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1 analog input connected to a potentiometer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;caption id=&#34;&#34; align=&#34;alignnone&#34; width=&#34;650&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pluggerogkontakter.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tiny13-programmer_bb.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img id=&#34;i-236&#34; class=&#34; wp-image&#34; title=&#34;Partlist for attiny13 devboard&#34; src=&#34;http://pluggerogkontakter.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tiny13-programmer_bb.png?w=650&#34; alt=&#34;partlist&#34; width=&#34;650&#34; height=&#34;304&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 10uF, 100uF capacitor handling 25V. 10K potentiometer. Two 2N2222 transistors. 3 push buttons (one for reset not shown). 3 regular LEDs as shown. 1 switch for power. LM7805 voltage regulator (+5V out). Restors as shown.&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If figured I would to projects with blinking LEDs, dimmers or motor controllers. All that will require PWM. Hence pin 6 and 5 were selected for output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the design it is worth nothing that the outputs of the AVR chip do not power the green and yellow LED directly. The reason for that is that pin 6 and 5 are used for in system programming, and are thus connected to our programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting LEDs directly to these same pins as used by the programmer could interfere with its operation. &lt;a title=&#34;Atmel AVR042: AVR Hardware Design Considerations&#34; href=&#34;http://www.atmel.com/images/doc2521.pdf&#34;&gt;ATMELs datasheets&lt;/a&gt;(page 6) says you should put in a series resistor between the load and the AVR. 10K would be a good value. I put in 22K and a transistor so very little current or voltage drop will happen to drive the LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can program the AVR without any external power because the AVR-ISP500 programmer I use delivers power to the AVR through pin 2 of ISP6 connector. With the transistors I am also able to program it while external power is connected and the circuit is running. This makes development a lot faster, because I do not need to unplug anything to test the circuit, or plug in anythin to transfer an updated version of my program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a very simple program I ran on it to make one of the LEDs blink. I will not explain the program here, because it is just something for you to try, to make sure it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  .include &amp;quot;tn13def.inc&amp;quot;
  .def a = r16
  .org 0000
   rjmp Reset

Reset:
   ;define output
   sbi DDRB, PB0
   sbi DDRB, PB1
   cbi PORTB, PB0 ;turn off LED
   cbi PORTB, PB1

   ;set prescaler to divide clock freq by 1024. 
   ;each count is about 0.8ms at 1.2MHz
   ldi a, 1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;CS02 | 1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;CS00
   out TCCR0B, a

   ;set blink frequency
   ldi a, 250
   out OCR0A, a
   ldi a, 250
   out OCR0B, a

   ;set CTC mode (clear timer/counter on compare)
   ldi a, 1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;WGM01 | 1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;COM0B0 | 1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;COM0A0 
   out TCCR0A, a 
loop:
   nop
   rjmp loop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
