      <description>When starting with out programming the AVR microcontroller on OS X, you will probably start by using CrossPack. However the problem with that is it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with a compiler meant to be used directly by you. It is mainly there for the C compiler. CrossPack installs the AVR GNU assembler avr-as described here. The assembly files typically end with .S. You can invoke it through gcc with e.g.
avr-gcc -Wall -Os -DF_CPU=8000000 -mmcu=attiny13 -x assembler-with-cpp -c ledflash.</description>
