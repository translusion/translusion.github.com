      <description>Electricity can be thought of as a fluid flowing through cables. Hence it is possible to mimic the operations of a computer with fluids.
In fact there is a whole engineering discipline devoted to this called fluidics and micro fluidics when dealing with extremely miniaturized devices. These devices work by using vacuum or pressure to pull or push a fluid through an intricate set of tiny pipes or tunnels. Presently the field of fluidics is mainly concerned with making devices for chemical and biological laboratories.</description>
