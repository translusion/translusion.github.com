    Cenk Uygur of the Young Turks news show covered a debate between Sam Harris and Noam Chomsky which I found interesting. I will not repeat the whole debate here but instead add my own thoughts. Personally I am somewhere between Sam Harris and Noam Chomsky in opinion although I definitely used to hold Sam Harris&rsquo; opinion that we in the west are completely different from the terrorists in that we do not generally kill with intention.

    If you grew up in the 80s or early 90s like me, you might have had great hopes for space exploration. You dreamed of giant space colonies beyound the year 2000. But then you grow up and the year 2000 comes and passes. Yet another decade pass and you realize that space exploration is just a long list of broken dreams. We achieved so much leading up to the end of the 70s and then nothing.

    Almost a year ago I wrote about playing Don’t Starve. I’ve had long breaks from it but had a burst playing it again a lot lately. So I wanted to write an updated strategy guide now that I feel I am a much better Don’t Starve Player. Surviving any number of days in Don’t Starve doesn’t seem that difficult anymore. Don’t Starve Reign of Giants is a bit trickier to not screw up though.

    I don&rsquo;t play much computer games anymore. Family and small kids limits time, but equally important I simply don&rsquo;t find them as fun anymore as I once did. Not long ago I got a Playstation 4 and I was eager to look at the beautiful graphics which could now be rendered. I got a bunch of third or first person shooters which all looked beautiful and amazing. But eventually they all ended up boring me.

    After doing various small Julia projects I&rsquo;ve had to learn a number of tricks or solutions to small problems, that I think would be usefull to collect: Parsing Strings Extract 3 numbers from a string into 3 variables: a, b, c = map(int, split(&quot;11 12 13&quot;)) Initialization There are some gotchas with Julia initialization if you come from C/C++ background although this should not be so odd to Python or Ruby developers.

      <span class="post-date">Sun, Dec 14, 2014</span>
    </header>

    I just read this blog about cool language constructs in Python. Before clicking it I thought to myself: are there cool things only Python can do or could I easily replicate this in my favorite script language Julia? So without further ado, her are some examples. Reverse an iterable There are two ways of doing this julia&gt; a = [1, 2, 4] 3-element Array{Int64,1}: 1 2 4 The most obvious way is the reverse function julia&gt; reverse(a) 3-element Array{Int64,1}: 4 2 1 But we can also do something similar to the Python example, exept Julia requires you to be a bit more explicit about the start and end of the slice julia&gt; a[end:-1:1] 3-element Array{Int64,1}: 4 2 1 This of course works for any types: julia&gt; reverse(b) (4,3,2) julia&gt; b[end:-1:1] (4,3,2) julia&gt; c = &quot;This is a string&quot; &quot;This is a string&quot; julia&gt; reverse(c) &quot;gnirts a si sihT&quot; Julia follows the Ruby convention of suffixing with !

    This is a rather hillarious heading, because who in their right mind believes in torture. Most people will say &ldquo;I support human rights&rdquo;. But then there are those who come with a big BUT. But there are of course those exceptional cases they say where an attack is imminent and we could tward the terrorists from killing thousands. This might of course also question how valuable is really human rights which only extends to those you love or deem good people, while nasty people don&rsquo;t get it.

      <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 8, 2014</span>
    </header>

    The Dynamic vs Static Typing debate has been going on for decades and never seems to end. While I like both static and dynamic programming languages I probably have a slight preference for dynamic typing. However I feel of the two types of languages I feel the dynamic ones are the ones that are most profoundly misunderstood. The popular blog post [Dynamic languages are static languages][dynisstatic] illustrates the misunderstanding very well.

    A lot of people assume that CEO salaries are completely determined by the market. But saying that something is determined by the market isn&rsquo;t very informative. The market as described in Economic text books full or rational individuals with perfect information about the products they are buying rarely exists. Michael B. Dorff shows in his book &ldquo;Indispensable and Other Myths&rdquo; how the &ldquo;market&rdquo; for CEOs isn&rsquo;t really a market. The most refreshing thing about the book I think is that he shows how essentially both sides of the debate about CEO salaries are quite wrong.

      <h2><a href='http://translusion.github.com/posts/swift_compared_to_python/'> An introduction to Swift for Python developers</a> </h2>
      <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 8, 2014</span>
    </header>

    While Swift fundamentally isn&rsquo;t very much like Python, it looks as if it has a number of similarities on the surface. For instance both have different REPL environments. These are great ways of learning how to code. I can use the Python REPL as a calculator: &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 3 5 &gt;&gt;&gt; 10 + 2 - 5 7 &gt;&gt;&gt; 3.5 * 2 7.0 &gt;&gt;&gt; We can do much the same with Swift: 1&gt; 2 + 3 $R0: Int = 5 2&gt; 10 + 2 - 5 $R1: Int = 7 3&gt; 3.5 * 2 $R2: Double = 7 4&gt; Although this is quite similar, we can already get a hint here that Swift is different and cares a lot more about type.

      <span class="post-date">Tue, Jul 15, 2014</span>
    </header>

    One of my favorite programming languages is Go, so I thought it might be fun to do a bit of a superficial comparison of it with Swift which I am hoping will be a new favorite given that I work professionally as an iOS developer. Go takes such a bare bones and simple approach to programming that one can quite quickly get a sense of what it is like using it.

    </header>

    Around the internet people are saying Apple&rsquo;s Swift looks like C#, JavaScript etc. This of course is just in the most superficial manner. E.g. both JavaScript and Swift has the var keyword. But it means completely different things since Swift is statically typed and JavaScript is not. Anyway being generally curious about programming languages I could see similarities in Swift with Rust, Go, Scala and Ruby. However all these languages differ from Swift in quite a number of ways.

    While the US isn&rsquo;t the richest country in the world in per capita GDP, it is by far the richest large country. It can boast of impressive results in science and innovation. Does that mean that anyone whishing to obtain similar levels of prosperity have to follow the American model for economic system and organization of society? My short answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The US is an outlier which has too many advantages not related to the organization of its economy or society.

    It is populare with peeing contests between America and Europe either in terms of GDP numbers, level of development, education, crime and what not. Of course regardless of how entertaining these sort of comparisons are, they are essentially apple to oranges comparisons. Europeans might score points by pointing to a number of of smaller European countries with very favorable statistics in a number of areas such as unemployment, human development index, crime rates, GDP etc.

    I&rsquo;ve recently performed a survey at my work using Google form, unfortunatle the data wasn&rsquo;t usable right out of the box, because it my company allowed people to register an answer multiple times, but one person should just have one vote. I chose to clean the data with the Julia programming language, which might not be the best choice for this sort of thing. Not because julia isn&rsquo;t suited but because SQL, sed or awk might do such a specialized and simple task faster.

    The heartbleed exploit made me thing of my own way of keeping passwords which relies on 1Password. What was painfull with 1Password was having to regenerate every single password I have over again. That is a lot of work. The second problem because all my passwords are too hard to remember, I am screwed if I ever lose my encrypted database of passwords. So I also make paper copies, but they have to be made secure as well, so they can not be used directly in their paper form.

    I got a bunch of ATtiny13 AVR microcontroller chips because I tought it would be fun to see what you can do with a tiny 8 pin microcontroller. The thought first popped into my mind when I looked at a project for creating motor controller for an electric spinning wheel. The project used the same chip as in an arduino with an arduino bootloader. The ATmega328 is a lot more expensive than a ATtiny13.

    </header>

    When starting with out programming the AVR microcontroller on OS X, you will probably start by using CrossPack. However the problem with that is it doesn&rsquo;t come with a compiler meant to be used directly by you. It is mainly there for the C compiler. CrossPack installs the AVR GNU assembler avr-as described here. The assembly files typically end with .S. You can invoke it through gcc with e.g. avr-gcc -Wall -Os -DF_CPU=8000000 -mmcu=attiny13 -x assembler-with-cpp -c ledflash.S This will assemble the file ledflash.S for the AVR microcontroller unit (MCU) ATtiny13.

    After Arduino So you tried Arduino programming. It is a great way to get introduced to Microcontrollers. But if you are actually an experienced programmer it doesn&rsquo;t quite feel like the real thing. It is sort of like learning BASIC when you know there is this other thing real programmers use which is C. Arduino is built around the AVR microcontroller. It simplifies a lot by providing a USB port on the board itself and having a loaded program to load your program into the memory of the AVR microcontroller.
