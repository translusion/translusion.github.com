      <h2><a href='http://translusion.github.com/posts/a_comparison_of_go_and_swift/'> Dynamic Typing as a Paradigm</a> </h2>
      <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 8, 2014</span>
    </header>

    The Dynamic vs Static Typing debate has been going on for decades and never seems to end. While I like both static and dynamic programming languages I probably have a slight preference for dynamic typing. However I feel of the two types of languages I feel the dynamic ones are the ones that are most profoundly misunderstood. The popular blog post Dynamic languages are static languages illustrates the misunderstanding very well.

      <h2><a href='http://translusion.github.com/posts/CEO%20Salaries/'> Indispensable and Other Myths</a> </h2>
      <span class="post-date">Mon, Nov 10, 2014</span>
    </header>

    A lot of people assume that CEO salaries are completely determined by the market. But saying that something is determined by the market isn&rsquo;t very informative. The market as described in Economic text books full or rational individuals with perfect information about the products they are buying rarely exists. Michael B. Dorff shows in his book &ldquo;Indispensable and Other Myths&rdquo; how the &ldquo;market&rdquo; for CEOs isn&rsquo;t really a market. The most refreshing thing about the book I think is that he shows how essentially both sides of the debate about CEO salaries are quite wrong.

      <h2><a href='http://translusion.github.com/posts/swift_compared_to_python/'> An introduction to Swift for Python developers</a> </h2>
      <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 8, 2014</span>
    </header>

    While Swift fundamentally isn&rsquo;t very much like Python, it looks as if it has a number of similarities on the surface. For instance both have different REPL environments. These are great ways of learning how to code. I can use the Python REPL as a calculator: &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 3 5 &gt;&gt;&gt; 10 + 2 - 5 7 &gt;&gt;&gt; 3.5 * 2 7.0 &gt;&gt;&gt; We can do much the same with Swift: 1&gt; 2 + 3 $R0: Int = 5 2&gt; 10 + 2 - 5 $R1: Int = 7 3&gt; 3.5 * 2 $R2: Double = 7 4&gt; Although this is quite similar, we can already get a hint here that Swift is different and cares a lot more about type.

      <h2><a href='http://translusion.github.com/posts/dynamic_typing_as_a_paradigme/'> Comparison of the Go tour with Swift</a> </h2>
      <span class="post-date">Tue, Jul 15, 2014</span>
    </header>

    One of my favorite programming languages is Go, so I thought it might be fun to do a bit of a superficial comparison of it with Swift which I am hoping will be a new favorite given that I work professionally as an iOS developer. Go takes such a bare bones and simple approach to programming that one can quite quickly get a sense of what it is like using it.

      <span class="post-date">Thu, Jun 5, 2014</span>
    </header>

    Around the internet people are saying Apple&rsquo;s Swift looks like C#, JavaScript etc. This of course is just in the most superficial manner. E.g. both JavaScript and Swift has the var keyword. But it means completely different things since Swift is statically typed and JavaScript is not. Anyway being generally curious about programming languages I could see similarities in Swift with Rust, Go, Scala and Ruby. However all these languages differ from Swift in quite a number of ways.

      <span class="post-date">Wed, Jun 4, 2014</span>
    </header>

    While the US isn&rsquo;t the richest country in the world in per capita GDP, it is by far the richest large country. It can boast of impressive results in science and innovation. Does that mean that anyone whishing to obtain similar levels of prosperity have to follow the American model for economic system and organization of society? My short answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The US is an outlier which has too many advantages not related to the organization of its economy or society.

      <span class="post-date">Tue, Jun 3, 2014</span>
    </header>

    It is populare with peeing contests between America and Europe either in terms of GDP numbers, level of development, education, crime and what not. Of course regardless of how entertaining these sort of comparisons are, they are essentially apple to oranges comparisons. Europeans might score points by pointing to a number of of smaller European countries with very favorable statistics in a number of areas such as unemployment, human development index, crime rates, GDP etc.

      <span class="post-date">Sun, May 11, 2014</span>
    </header>

    I&rsquo;ve recently performed a survey at my work using Google form, unfortunatle the data wasn&rsquo;t usable right out of the box, because it my company allowed people to register an answer multiple times, but one person should just have one vote. I chose to clean the data with the Julia programming language, which might not be the best choice for this sort of thing. Not because julia isn&rsquo;t suited but because SQL, sed or awk might do such a specialized and simple task faster.

    Here are some of my notes from learning rails. I am following the course Web Application Architectures at Coursera. This is seen from perspective of someone used to more desktop applications. I used Ruby as a scripting language for writing small unix tools in the past, but I am not considering myself very up to date. Setup Project Have rails autogenerate a bunch of files for a project: $ rails new myproject This seems to be the way to create a new model class with corresponding table in database: $ rails generate scaffold comment post_id:integer body:text This will to a whole bunch of things.

      <span class="post-date">Sun, May 4, 2014</span>
    </header>

    The heartbleed exploit made me thing of my own way of keeping passwords which relies on 1Password. What was painfull with 1Password was having to regenerate every single password I have over again. That is a lot of work. The second problem because all my passwords are too hard to remember, I am screwed if I ever lose my encrypted database of passwords. So I also make paper copies, but they have to be made secure as well, so they can not be used directly in their paper form.

    This is a distilation of my last weeks of experience building an AVR curcuit on a breadboard and prototype board and programming it in assembly. Look at one of my previous post to see how you get up to speed with the assembler, avrdude for transfering programs etc. Continuity Buzzer When I wanted to check whether to points on my circuit were connected before I turned my multimeter on measuring resistance (power turned off of course).

      <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 24, 2013</span>
    </header>

    I got a bunch of ATtiny13 AVR microcontroller chips because I tought it would be fun to see what you can do with a tiny 8 pin microcontroller. The thought first popped into my mind when I looked at a project for creating motor controller for an electric spinning wheel. The project used the same chip as in an arduino with an arduino bootloader. The ATmega328 is a lot more expensive than a ATtiny13.

      <span class="post-date">Tue, Mar 5, 2013</span>
    </header>

    When starting with out programming the AVR microcontroller on OS X, you will probably start by using CrossPack. However the problem with that is it doesn&rsquo;t come with a compiler meant to be used directly by you. It is mainly there for the C compiler. CrossPack installs the AVR GNU assembler avr-as described here. The assembly files typically end with .S. You can invoke it through gcc with e.g. avr-gcc -Wall -Os -DF_CPU=8000000 -mmcu=attiny13 -x assembler-with-cpp -c ledflash.S This will assemble the file ledflash.S for the AVR microcontroller unit (MCU) ATtiny13.

    After Arduino So you tried Arduino programming. It is a great way to get introduced to Microcontrollers. But if you are actually an experienced programmer it doesn&rsquo;t quite feel like the real thing. It is sort of like learning BASIC when you know there is this other thing real programmers use which is C. Arduino is built around the AVR microcontroller. It simplifies a lot by providing a USB port on the board itself and having a loaded program to load your program into the memory of the AVR microcontroller.
